The Turn Around Time is defined as the time taken by a security analyst from the point of when they pick up an Open Source project under test until the point when they upload the assessment reports and attestation to it.

**Setting Up Environment:**
For a security analyst to perform the security assessment of a particular Open-Source project, it requires certain tools, dependencies, and configurations to be set up. This setup creation can vary from simple to complex depending upon the complexity of the project under test. This may take a few hours to days together to successfully set up an environment for an open-source project. Moreover, every open-source project needs to have a different set of environments to assess than the other, and both need to be independent of each other for a proper assessment of an Open-Source project.

So, this time taken to set up the environment does increase the Turn Around Time of the security analyst for a particular Open-Source.

**Be-Secure Solution:**
This is where Be-Secure comes to rescue. The tools and playbooks developed by the Be-Secure community help a security analyst quickly set up a lab with the required tools and utilities by using playbooks developed for BeSlab as well as targeted specifically for a particular Open-Source project.

The security analyst can use these tools and playbooks to quickly perform the assessment on an Open-Source and provide the assessment report in the shortest possible time frame.

This enables the security analysts to perform assessments on many more Open Source projects rather than a few projects in the same given time frame, hence increasing productivity.

It also allows the security analysts to focus on the particular project rather than the dependencies or surrounding environment complexities of an Open-Source project.
