- `'require': cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)`
  
  This error occurs when you run `jekyll serve` on Ruby 3.0+. 

  Ruby 3.0 no longer comes with Webrick by default. To fix this, add `gem "webrick"` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`. See [jekyll/jekyll#8523](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523)
