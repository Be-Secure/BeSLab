Include  BeSLab environments repo for the BeS community that can work seamlessly on oah-bes-vm in low cost/low resource settings.

(Important to have this in place asap. I had a quick discussion with Samir & Sudhir.  Being able to present a roadmap for our OSS is critical for us to meaningfully engage community contributors & OSS security researchers.)
